"""Template & CSS structural invariant tests.

Verifies the source files BEFORE they are pushed to Anki:
  - Front card never renders a furigana-bearing field (back-card-only rule)
  - Front is a pure retrieval surface (no tags/badges/metadata UI)
  - Listening is a hidden-by-default resolver: #listening tag or classic
    audio-only fields activate it; the sentence front is the fallback
  - Secondary back information is collapsed behind "More ▾"
  - Audio buttons carry aria-labels; controller is restart-only
  - Lightbox closes only on backdrop clicks (not on the enlarged image)
  - Anki template conditionals are balanced
  - CSS contains the accessibility/portability rules

Run directly:  python3 tests/test_templates.py
Wired into finish.sh step 0 alongside test_compactor.py.

Pure standard library — no dependencies.
